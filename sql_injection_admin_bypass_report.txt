Penetration Test Report: Admin Authentication Bypass via SQL Injection

Target: jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/login.php

Summary:
- Located login form with fields username, password, debug (hidden).
- Tested classical SQLi payloads (' OR '1'='1' --, etc.) manually and via tool simulation.
- Server returned "<h1>SQLi detected.</h1>", indicating in-line SQLi input detection.
- Attempted multiple obfuscated payload variants; all detected or no bypass seen.
- No alternative endpoints or parameters found for login bypass.
- Awaiting manual confirmation tests, no positive admin login via SQLi found.

Conclusion: Authentication bypass via SQLi not achievable with tested payloads; server-side filters thwart injection.

Recommendations:
- Explore other vulnerabilities or attack surfaces.
- Review authentication mechanisms and error handling.
